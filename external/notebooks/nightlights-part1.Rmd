title: "Can Night Lights Detect Flood Lights?"
output: github_document
---

Between August 2015 and March 2016, [341 lights](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nycha/about/press/pr-2016/polo-grounds-20160310.page) were installed for crime mitigation at the Polo Grounds Towers, a housing development owned by the New York City Public housing housing authority. 

For this exercise, we are going to examine whether the illumination of those flood lights can be detected using night lights data, by looking for differences in illumination before and after the periods of installation.

This represents a fine-grained spatial analysis, as the location in question represents a single pixel in the night lights dataset.  


```{r include=FALSE}
library(terra)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Datasets
We will first start by loading the data we need:

- A set of images representing the time series of monthly night lights data over New York City covering the period 2012-2021, as well as the monthly average over the period and the average of each month during the 10 year period.
- The location of the Polo Grounds public housing project in NYC.
- Data showing where NYC's public housing projects are located
- Census tracts for New York City 

```{r}
sysfiles <- function(x) {
  system.file(paste0("extdata/", x), package = "USFlite")
}
  
# NYC census tracts
nytract <- readRDS(sysfiles("nytract.RDS")) 

# NYC public housing developments
nycha <- readRDS(sysfiles("nycha.RDS")) 
nyc <- readRDS(sysfiles("nyc.rds")) 

# Polo Grounds Towers to test hypothesis - capture floodlight presence
polo <- readRDS(sysfiles("polo.RDS"))

# Nightlights data, monthly, average for each month over 20 years, 20 year 
# mean
nlights <- rast(sysfiles("nightlights.tif"))
nlight_mo <- rast(sysfiles("nightlights_mean_month.tif"))
nlights <- rast(sysfiles("nightlights.tif"))
nlight_lt <- rast(sysfiles("nightlights_mean.tif"))
nl_dates <- readRDS(sysfiles("nightlight_dates.rds"))
```

### NYC public housing

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
p <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = nytract, col = alpha("grey9", 0.1), fill = "grey") +
  geom_sf(data = nycha, aes(fill = 'A'), col = "blue4", 
          show.legend = "polygon", inherit.aes = F) + 
  geom_sf(data = polo, aes(fill = 'B'), col = NA,
          show.legend = "polygon", inherit.aes = F) +
  geom_sf(data = polo %>% st_geometry() %>% st_centroid() %>% st_buffer(2000), 
          fill = NA, col = 'red4', show.legend = F, inherit.aes = F)
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("A" = "blue", "B" = "red"), 
    labels = c("Public Housing Developments", "Polo Grounds Towers")
  ) + xlab('') + ylab('') + theme_void() + theme(legend.position = c(0.2, 0.9)) 
ggsave(p, file = here("external/notebooks/figures/nyc_housing.png"), 
       height = 7, width = 7, dpi = 300)
```

The map below shows New York City's public housing developments, with the location of the Polo Grounds project shown in red.

### Night lights data over NYC
Let's now look at the nightlights data over New York. We will start just with overall brightness. The image below is the average monthly brightness of NYC lights between the years 2012 - and 2021. 

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
p <- ggplot(as.data.frame(nlight_lt, xy = TRUE)) + 
  geom_raster(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = X2012.2021)) +
  geom_sf(data = nyc, fill = "transparent", col = "yellow", size = 0.2) +
  geom_sf(data = polo, col = "blue") + 
  geom_sf(data = st_buffer(polo, dist = 2000), fill = "transparent", 
          col = "red") + 
  scale_fill_distiller(
    guide = guide_colorbar(title = "nWatts·cm−2·sr−1", ticks = FALSE),
    type = "seq", direction = -1, palette = "Greys"
  ) + xlab('') + ylab('') + theme_void()
p
```

### Brightness over the Polo Grounds public housing project

We are now going to extract the full 12 year record of monthly night light data from the location of the Polo Grounds Towers, as well as the averages for each month and long term monthly averages, and test whether a change in brightness can be detected following the dates of installation.

First we will extract and average the data. The footprint of the Polo Ground Towers actually overlaps two pixels, so we will average across the two pixels first.  
```{r}
pologcs <- st_transform(polo, 4326)
polo_lts_ts <- colMeans(extract(nlights, vect(pologcs))[-1])
polo_lts_mo <- colMeans(extract(nlight_mo, vect(pologcs))[-1])
polo_lts_mu <- colMeans(extract(nlight_lt, vect(pologcs))[-1])

lts_tbl <- tibble(date = nl_dates, lts = unname(polo_lts_ts)) %>% 
  mutate(mo = strftime(date, "%m"), yr = strftime(date, "%Y"))  # add mo/year
```

#### Changes in monthly brightness
Now we will plot and look for any pattern, starting with the time series. The blue points represent the monthly brightness values, and the grey line shows the long term mean brightness, while the red line shows the time period when the floodlights were installed. 
```{r}
inst_dts <- as.Date(c("2015-08-01", "2016-03-31"), "%Y-%m-%d")
p <- ggplot() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = polo_lts_mu, color = "grey") + 
  geom_linerange(aes(y = polo_lts_mu, xmin = inst_dts[1], xmax = inst_dts[2]), 
                 col = "red", size = 2) + 
  geom_point(data = lts_tbl, aes(x = date, y = lts), col = "blue") + 
  ylab("nWatts·cm−2·sr−1") + xlab("") + 
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 months", date_labels = "%Y-%m") + 
  theme_linedraw() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))
p
```

Looking at the results, we don't really see anything obvious in terms of a difference in brightness after the period of installation. There are some notable peaks on either side, with the highest peaks before the installation occurred (we will discuss what might cause these peaks).

Let's take a look another way. The time series seems to suggest that the least bright periods of the year are in the summer, around July-August (why might that be?). Is there a difference in the brightness levels in the June-July-August before and after lights installation? 

```{r}
summers_before <- lts_tbl %>% 
  filter(yr <= 2015 & mo %in% c("06", "07", "08")) %>% 
  summarise(lts = mean(lts))
summers_after <- lts_tbl %>% 
  filter(yr >= 2016 & mo %in% c("06", "07", "08")) %>% 
  summarise(lts = mean(lts))
```

The average brightness of the three summer month before / during the installation had an average brightness of **`r round(summers_before)`** nWatts/cm^2/sr, while afterwards it was **`r round(summers_after)`**, so it was actually a bit less bright after that, although the difference is maybe small and may just due to noise. 

How about the entire period before August, 2018, compared to the period after April 2016 (to start from approximately the same time of year). In this case we will calculate the median, rather than the mean, to try control the effects of those large peaks, which can skew averages. 
```{r}
before <- lts_tbl %>% 
  filter(date <= "2015-08-01") %>% summarise(lts = median(lts))
after <- lts_tbl %>% 
  filter(date >= "2016-04-01") %>% summarise(lts = mean(lts))
```

That gives a value of **`r round(before)`** nWatts/cm^2/sr for before, and **`r round(after)`** after. 

So that does reflect some increase in the median value after light installation. However, it is hard to say whether that is a true change in brightness, or just other factors, including measurement error, as it is fairly small change (+`r round((after - before) / before * 100, 1)`%). 

We will move on to look at the next example.
